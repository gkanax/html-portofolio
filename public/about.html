<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am George Kanakis, living in Chaidari and started doing some more interesting staff since 1/1/2023.
   Firstly I decided that the current work I am doing isn't offering much on personal develpoment.</p>

<p>Thus, I decided to enhance my CV, by doing some python trainings. I have done already many of those and still
  learning. Moreover, I have done some Kubernetes and docker seminars.
  Last, here I am, doing some web developer seminars to imporve my skills and prepare some personal webpages.
</p>

<p>I hope that in one year from now, I will have complete both python and web developer seminars.</p>
